configure ssh keys for github.

copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and upload to github at https://github.com/settings/keys - new ssh keys

then clone again as "git clone git@github.com:puneetbhatia77/helloworld.git"

or modify .git/config

[remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:puneetbhatia77/helloworld.git

To verify the connection, "ssh -T git@github.com".
Now you can push without entering password. "git push origin master".

If you change private key "~/.ssh/id_rsa" in local machine or delete ssh key from git hub and try  "ssh -T git@github.com".  or "git push origin master" then it will not allow.
